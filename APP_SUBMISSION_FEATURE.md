# App Submission Feature

This document describes the newly added app submission functionality that allows developers to submit completed apps for ideas posted on the platform.

## Overview

The app submission feature consists of several components that work together to provide a seamless experience for developers to showcase their implementations of ideas:

## Components Added

### 1. AppSubmissionForm (`/src/components/apps/AppSubmissionForm.tsx`)
A comprehensive form component that allows developers to input:
- **App name** (required)
- **Description** (optional)
- **App URL** (optional) - for web apps or store pages
- **Screenshots** (optional) - multiple image uploads with preview
- **Store URLs** (optional) - separate fields for App Store and Google Play Store

Features:
- File validation for screenshots (image types, 5MB limit)
- URL validation
- Image preview with delete functionality
- Responsive design

### 2. AppSubmissionModal (`/src/components/apps/AppSubmissionModal.tsx`)
A modal wrapper that:
- Contains the submission form
- Handles submission states (loading, success, error)
- Provides keyboard navigation (Escape to close)
- Auto-closes after successful submission

### 3. SubmitAppButton (`/src/components/apps/SubmitAppButton.tsx`)
A reusable button component that:
- Shows different states for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- Supports primary and secondary variants
- Opens the submission modal when clicked
- Displays appropriate messaging for non-authenticated users

### 4. Server Action (`/src/app/actions/submitApp.ts`)
A server action that:
- Validates user authentication
- Processes form data
- Uploads screenshots to Supabase Storage
- Inserts app data into the database
- Updates idea status to 'completed' when first app is submitted
- Handles errors gracefully

## Integration

### Idea Detail Page Updates
The idea detail page (`/src/app/ideas/[id]/page.tsx`) now includes:

1. **Header Submit Button**: A secondary button next to the "Want" button for quick access
2. **Call-to-Action Section**: A prominent section encouraging app submission (only shown when no apps exist)
3. **Additional Submission Option**: For ideas with existing apps, allowing multiple implementations

## Database Structure

The feature uses the existing `completed_apps` table with the following schema:
```sql
CREATE TABLE completed_apps (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  idea_id UUID REFERENCES ideas(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  developer_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  app_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  app_url TEXT,
  store_urls JSONB,
  screenshots TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## File Storage

Screenshots are stored in Supabase Storage in a bucket named `app-screenshots`. The storage setup SQL is provided in `supabase_storage_setup.sql`.

## User Experience

### For Developers:
1. Browse ideas on the platform
2. Click "アプリを投稿" (Submit App) button on idea detail pages
3. Fill out the submission form with app details
4. Upload optional screenshots
5. Submit the form
6. See confirmation and automatic page update

### For Idea Creators and Users:
1. View submitted apps in the "このアイデアから生まれたアプリ" (Apps Born from This Idea) section
2. Access app links and store pages
3. View screenshots and descriptions
4. See developer information

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- App ratings and reviews system (already partially implemented)
- Categories for different types of implementations
- Featured apps section
- Developer profiles and portfolios
- Integration with external APIs for app metadata
